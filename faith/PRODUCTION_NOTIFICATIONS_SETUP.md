# Production Push Notifications Setup

## üö® Important: Production Requirements

Your current implementation uses **local notifications** (not remote push notifications), which means **most of these steps are NOT required** for your current setup. However, here's what you need for both scenarios:

## üì± Current Setup (Local Notifications) - Minimal Requirements

### ‚úÖ What You Already Have
- `faith.entitlements` with `aps-environment: development`
- Local notification scheduling (no server required)
- All code implemented and working

### üîß For App Store Release

#### 1. Update Entitlements for Production
**File:** `faith/faith/faith.entitlements`
```xml
<key>aps-environment</key>
<string>production</string>  <!-- Change from 'development' -->
```

#### 2. App Store Submission
- No additional setup required for local notifications
- They work offline and don't require server infrastructure

---

## üåê If You Want Remote Push Notifications (Advanced)

If you want to send notifications from a server (not just local scheduling), you'll need:

### 1. Apple Developer Console Setup

#### A. Enable Push Notifications Capability
1. Go to [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
3. Click **Identifiers** ‚Üí Select your app ID (`com.team.faith`)
4. Check **Push Notifications** capability
5. Click **Save**

#### B. Generate APNs Key (Recommended)
1. In Developer Console, go to **Keys**
2. Click **+** to create new key
3. Check **Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)**
4. Click **Continue** ‚Üí **Register**
5. **Download the .p8 file** (keep it secure!)
6. Note the **Key ID** and **Team ID**

#### C. Alternative: APNs Certificates (Legacy)
1. In your app identifier, click **Configure** next to Push Notifications
2. Create certificates for Development and Production
3. Download and install in Keychain Access

### 2. Xcode Configuration

#### A. Add Push Notifications Capability
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your **faith** target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Click **+ Capability**
5. Add **Push Notifications**

#### B. Update Entitlements
Your `faith.entitlements` should have:
```xml
<key>aps-environment</key>
<string>production</string>
<key>com.apple.developer.aps-environment</key>
<string>production</string>
```

### 3. Backend Implementation (If Using Remote Push)

#### A. Server Setup
You'll need a server that can:
- Store device tokens
- Send push notifications via APNs
- Check lesson completion status
- Schedule conditional notifications

#### B. Device Token Registration
```swift
// In your app delegate or SwiftUI App
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    let tokenString = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02.2hhx", $0) }.joined()
    // Send to your server
    sendDeviceTokenToServer(tokenString)
}
```

## üìã Production Checklist for Your Current Setup

### ‚úÖ Required (Local Notifications)
- [ ] Change `aps-environment` to `production` in entitlements
- [ ] Test on real device (not just simulator)
- [ ] Verify notifications work after app is backgrounded
- [ ] Test notification tap handling
- [ ] Verify badge clearing works
- [ ] Test with different iOS versions

### ‚úÖ Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add notification settings to ProfileView
- [ ] Test multiple reminder times
- [ ] Verify streak-based messaging
- [ ] Test evening reminder functionality

### ‚úÖ App Store Submission
- [ ] Update app description to mention daily reminders
- [ ] Add screenshots showing notification permission screen
- [ ] Test on TestFlight before release
- [ ] Verify notifications work in production build

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup Steps for Production

### 1. Update Entitlements (Required)
```bash
cd /Users/jared/faith_mono/faith
```

Then edit `faith/faith/faith.entitlements`:
```xml
<key>aps-environment</key>
<string>production</string>
```

### 2. Test on Real Device
1. Connect iPhone/iPad via USB
2. Select your device in Xcode
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)
4. Test notification flow
5. Verify they work when app is closed

### 3. Archive for App Store
1. **Product** ‚Üí **Archive**
2. **Distribute App** ‚Üí **App Store Connect**
3. Upload to TestFlight
4. Test notifications in TestFlight build

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### Notifications Not Working in Production
1. **Check entitlements** - Must be `production` not `development`
2. **Test on real device** - Simulator behaves differently
3. **Verify permissions** - User must grant permission
4. **Check Do Not Disturb** - Notifications hidden if DND is on

### Badge Not Appearing
1. **Check notification settings** - User might have disabled badges
2. **Verify badge count** - Should be set to 1 in notification content
3. **Test clearing** - Badge should clear when app opens

### Notification Tap Not Working
1. **Check delegate setup** - Must be set in app launch
2. **Verify userInfo** - Check notification contains correct type
3. **Test deep linking** - Should navigate to daily lesson

## üéØ Your Current Status

‚úÖ **You're already 95% ready for production!**

Your local notifications will work perfectly in the App Store with just:
1. Changing `aps-environment` to `production`
2. Testing on real devices
3. Submitting to App Store

No server setup, no APNs keys, no complex backend required! üéâ

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test current implementation** - Make sure everything works
2. **Update entitlements** - Change to production
3. **Test on real device** - Verify notifications work
4. **Submit to App Store** - You're ready!

Your smart notification system is production-ready! üôè‚ú®
